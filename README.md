# CCPROMISE
CCPROMISE, Canonical correlation with PROjection onto the Most Interesting Statistical Evidence, is a general procedure to integrate two forms of genomic features that 
exhibit a specific biologically interesting pattern of association with multiple phenotypic endpoint variables. 
In biology, one type of genomic feature tends to regulate the other types. For example, DNA methylation regulates gene expression. Biological knowledge of the endpoint variables is used to define a vector that represents the biologically most interesting values for a set of association statistics. 
The CCPROMISE performs one hypothesis test for each gene, and is flexible to accommodate two type of genomic features with various types of endpoints.
