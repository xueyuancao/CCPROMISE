Title: PROMISE analysis with Canonical Correlation for Two Forms of High Dimensional Genetic Data
<<<<<<< HEAD
Version: 0.99.2
Author: Xueyuan Cao <xueyuan.cao@stjude.org> and Stanley.pounds <stanley.pounds@stjude.org>
Maintainer: Xueyuan Cao <xueyuan.cao@stjude.org>
Description: Perform Canonical correlation between two forms of high demensional genetic data, and associate the first compoent of each form of data with a specific biologically interesting pattern of associations with multiple endpoints. A probe level analysis is also implemented.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0), stats, methods, CCP, PROMISE, Biobase, GSEABase, utils
